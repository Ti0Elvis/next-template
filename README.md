# UI Project Generator

This is a **command-line tool** to quickly scaffold a Next.js + TailwindCSS project with pre-selected UI components and hooks, inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool does **not** aim to replace or take credit for [shadcn/ui]. It is simply a utility for convenience and faster setup in personal and internal projects. All UI components are sourced directly from shadcn.
